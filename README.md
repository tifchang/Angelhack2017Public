## Parro: an automated interviewing platform
This product was built for AngelHack 2017 Silicon Valley

#### Frontend
Our frontend was built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Bulma](http://bulma.io/), a responsive, flex-box based CSS framework. Parro's seamless user interface required little to no user effort, as in the entire experience was guided by us. Therefore, managing state as well as event handling got complicated.
